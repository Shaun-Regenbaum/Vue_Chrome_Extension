# Vue_Chrome_Extension ðŸŽ«
### This is a Vue Chrome Extension Boilerplate that demonstrates how to make an HTTP Request Manipulator.
- First of all, this extension **only** works on Chromium based browsers (so Google Chrome, etc...)
- Second of all, this extension can **only** remove paywalls on websites that offer at least one free article.

#### In order to use it simply follow these directions:
1. Download the "extension" folder through the latest release (on the right side of the screen) or clone the repository.
2. Go to the chrome extensions page (you can do this through options or simply go to chrome:\\\\extensions).
3. Turn on Developer Mode on the top right of the page.
4. Click on the "Load Unpacked" button on the top left of the screen and select the "extension" folder.
5. That's it, it should be installed and working like a normal chrome extension (you can also pin it to your broswer bar for easy access).

## Notes
In order to use this chrome extension on mobile, you must use a Chromium based mobile browser that allows mobile extensions.
Sadly, Chrome does not support this at the current moment, thus you will have to use a browser like Kiwi.

## Recognition
Special thanks to [Dan Jutan](https://github.com/jutanium) for explaining the horrors of promises and [Matthew Sklar](https://github.com/matthewsklar) for the sanity checks.


## Development
Working on the front end to make it look nicer.
